# APPLICATIONS-OF-IMAGE-PROCESSING-FOR-LEAF-DISEASES-IDENTIFICATION-USING-PYTHON
Agricultural products are a primary need for every country. In agriculture, farmers face a lot of problems in disease identification in plant leave. 
Late identification of diseases in plants causes economic losses to farmer which affects the economy of the country on a large scale. It is very difficult to moni-tor plant diseases manually. It requires a tremendous amount of work and re-quires the excessive processing time. Hence, image processing is used for the detection of plant disease. In this project, we focused on the classification of plants as a different type of disease which represents an algorithm for image segmentation technique that is used for detection and classification of plant leaf diseases. We use Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which comprises of dif-ferent layers used in disease identification. In Disease detection there are steps like image acquisition, ¬¬image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature ex-traction, classification, and mail of detection report. The research that has been done can be proven by the classification of leaf diseases which get an average accuracy rate of 80.348%.
